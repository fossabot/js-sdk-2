This repository contains the JavaScript implementations of [OpenFeature][openfeature-website], a vendor-agnostic abstraction library for evaluating feature flags.

We support multiple data types for flags (numbers, strings, booleans, objects) as well as hooks, which can alter the lifecycle of a flag evaluation.
